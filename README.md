# Simple 2D Engine 

My first coding project I developed in my school days.

![Preview gif](img/engine_preview.gif?raw=true "Preview gif")

Written on Java 1.6 using LibGDX framework.
This project has much cringe in it starting with its naming. Though in unfinished state, it still works.

Before the project was abandoned I implemented circle-circle collision detection and resolution with QuadTree algorithm for collision detection.

There is a lot of weird and low quality code, but I leave this repo as is.

## Usage

Run `src/com/me/maee/MainClass.java`. Use Java 1.6 version.
